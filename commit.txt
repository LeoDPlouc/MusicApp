Put the song collection in a separated thread, move some logic and datastructures to MusicLib, create some objects to manage song, album, artist collection

The song collection is now in a thread so the collection doesn't lock the app during the process. The collection is retriggerd every 5 sec during the lifetime of the app

Beans from MusicApp have been merged with beans from MusicLib, plans is to move all the logic and datastructures to MusicLib et have MusicApp only beeing a front end to the objects in MusicLib

Collection objects have been created to better manage lists of songs, album and artists
